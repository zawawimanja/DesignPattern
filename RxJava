@Query(“SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = :userId”)
Flowable<User> getUserById(String userId);
Here’s how the Flowable/Observable behaves:
When there is no user in the database and the query returns no rows, the Flowable will not emit, neither onNext, nor onError.
When there is a user in the database, the Flowable will trigger onNext.
Every time the user data is updated, the Flowable object will emit automatically, allowing you to update the UI based on the latest data.
