 ORM - object relational mapping
 Room is designed to abstract away the underlying database tables and queries. 
  Room will eventually be converted to SQLite code
 Therefore it provides an easy way to create and use Sqlite database. 
 It is based on best-practices for persisting data in database.
 If you want to save a non-primitive type such as a  List or  Date , you would have to provide a type converter for it.
 With TypeConverter you tell Room how to convert the non-primitive type to a primate type. 
 
 
   // Room components
    implementation "android.arch.persistence.room:runtime:$rootProject.roomVersion"
    annotationProcessor "android.arch.persistence.room:compiler:$rootProject.roomVersion"
 
 
Step 1  : Component 1 in room — Create an entity/model class:
Entity (which represents the SQLite table) for your words
Each public property in the class represents a column in the table. 

Step 2: Component 2 in room — Create a DAO class:

Step 3: Component 3 in room — Create Database class:

Step 4: Create the Repository class:
